0.   pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis is the longest word in english
1.  getrusage returns information about all the resources used by the current thread.
2.  struct has 16 members
3.  Before and after are passed to getrusage to determine the resource use at the point in time before and after the event that we want to measure. 
    This allows the program to then use the calculatefunction to determine the contribution of the event to resource usage and time consumed by the event's process
4.  The section's for loop is initialized equating an int value to the result of fgetc(fp), this function gets a character from a stream until the End of File (EOF).
    The stream is then incremented character by character. The characters are then filtered so that they are alphanumeric or apostrophes, and to filter out spaces and line breaks
    and so on. The characters are used to constitute words that are shorter than the max length. The rest of the loop goes into checking each word against the dictionary.
5.  Fgetc provides much more control over what characters are allowed to filter through to the constituted string. 
    Usign a string by string reading function, such as fscanf would introduce problems where the string may contain undesirable characters, and need to be subsequently corrected.
6.  The parameters passed to load and check are declared using const because they are not allowed to change.
    This helps the program deal with these paramteres with optimum efficiency.
